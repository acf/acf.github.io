I'm writing this all out here, mostly so I can point to it from a micro.blog post and ask for some suggestions.

**What I Want**

I like the idea that I post what I'm going to continue to call my 'tweets' to _My Own Thing_ and that they are just mirrored into twitter (_Someone Else's Thing_).  There's some confusion there around replies.  If someone on twitter replies to my tweet and I go into twitter to reply back, thats **not** going to be on _My Own Thing_, but in general I like the idea of my posts, both long and short, being _My Own Thing_.

**What I have**

*   I have an existing blog, here, on Wordpress.  Its available as both [alancfrancis.com](http://alancfrancis.com/) and [alancfrancis.wordpress.com](http://alancfrancis.wordpress.com).
*   I have a twitter account [@PossiblyAlan](http://twitter.com/possiblyalan).  I haven't switch micro.blog to mirror to it yet.
*   I have registered for [micro.blog](http://micro.blog/) as **acf.**  I have a paid plan which gives me acf.micro.blog, which is not _My Own Thing_, its _Manton's Thing_.
*   I have created a [GitHub pages repo](https://github.com/acf/acf.github.io) and sent micro.blog to mirror into it (though its not jekyll-configured yet).  So currently I post to _Mantons Thing_ and then mirrored into _My Own Thing._
*   I have the micro.blog apps for iOS and Mac, which can post to micro.blog or Wordpress.
*   I have the Wordpress iOS app for posting to Wordpress.

**Questions I Have**

It seems like I should ditch the hosted micro.blog as it runs against the idea of posting to _My Own Thing_.  I'm currently just posting to _Mantons Thing_ instead of _Jack Dorsey's Thing_ and then mirroring into _Githubs Thing_.

That means that I'd essentially just post to wordpress and have hit be mirrored into _Mantons Thing_ which would then mirror it into _Jack Dorsey's Thing_.

Does that then mean that all micro.blog would be is a way to put my Wordpress posts into the micro.blog audience and the twitter audience?  I can't see why I'd need the apps then?  They say they can post to Wordpress, but I can already do that with more complete tools.  This feels like I must be missing something.

Maybe I'm confusing a bunch of use cases ?

Perhaps one use case is you stop using twitter, and you switch to using the micro.blog apps and a hosted micro.blog and you swap _Jack's Thing_ for _Manton's Thing_, but you know you can get at _Manton's Thing_ via RSS or export it.  Thats one use case for **someone**, but not me as it's still not _My Own Thing_, its just a safer and more open _Someone Else's Thing_.

The other use case where I post to Wordpress ( _My Own Thing_ )  and just use a micro.blog username to consume the RSS and cross post to the micro.blog TL and the twitter TL is a separate thing that doesn't require the micro.blog apps at all?

Assume I post direct to Wordpress, then.  I am ignoring the micro.blog app and hosted solution and just posting to _My Own Thing._  Do I keep posting short and long form posts to _alancfrancis.com_ ?  Will micro.blog show short form posts inline and link to long form ones?  Maybe I should create a second Wordpress blog _micro.alancfrancis.com_ which is just the micro.blog?  That means its always 'tweets' and they can be duplicated into the micro.blog timeline and twitter, but it does mean its entirely separate from the main wordpress blog.

\*sigh\*

Anyway, analysis paralysis and thoughts welcomed.

**UPDATE: I just cancelled my subscription.  The only story I could actually understand was the hosted one which mean I was just posting to _Mantons' Thing_ instead of _Jack's Thing_ and that didn't seem worth the effort_._  I'll just keep tweeting on twitter and blogging here on Wordpress.**
