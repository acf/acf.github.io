I started my post-college career as a Microsoft Windows developer, building a visitor centre application for Scottish Nuclear's "Come and See" program in 1995. Â Microsoft's Visual C++ and the MFC framework meant it was relatively easy to make an app "look and feel" like Windows. Â You really had to go out of your way to make a really bad UI, but obviously that didn't stop everyone.

My code back then wasn't great. Â Wasn't the cleanest. Â Didn't have much attention lavished on its internal structure.

By 2000 I was a Java developer and developing client side apps for Windows was an exercise in frustration, so I welcomed the switch to serverside - servlets and JSP. Â On that team we had front end people and designers to build the HTML and CSS, so I was able to concentrate on building a good model and controller layer. Â This was the era of TDD and patterns, refactoring. Â Complete focus on the structure of the code. Â Beautiful on the inside was all I cared about.

Around 2006 I switched to Ruby and Rails, but still I had people to worry about the UI. Â I could keep my head clear for refactoring, code smells, classes and methods and structure and not be worrying really about how the app looked. Â This was immensely satisfying in the dayjobs, where the front end team could be relied upon to take care of stuff. Â It was, however, immensely frustrating in personal side projects. Sure I could build a basic little app to store comics, or run a conference, but I lacked any of the skills to make it look good enough to release to the public. Â I quickly gave up.

Then, in 2008, the iPhone.

A return to my days of Windows. Â A standard platform look and feel. Â An IDE that allowed one to make HIG compliant, clean UIs., Â Again you had to work hard to make something horrible, it was easy to make something look decent. Â Satisfying. Â My little home projects looked reasonable. Â I didn't feel like I needed a designer to do the front end stuff.

Now, looking at these three phases - Windows, web apps, iOS it strikes me that in each case I'm saying I don't have to worry too much about the UI. Â Either because the tools make it easy for me, or because someone else is worrying about it. Â In all three cases I should be free to focus on the internal quality of my code. Â To do the things I love, looking for places where code belongs elsewhere, or theres an abstraction that will clear up a ton of code (I'm much happier refactoring code than I am writing it :).

What I notice though is that even though the UI is "easy" (_very simple little apps remember, I'm not saying all UI/UX work is easy, just that its easy to make something thats not horrible_) having to write those classes at that level means I take my eye off the ball. Â I sacrifice a lot of model-level awareness and attention because I'm building the app one ViewController at a time instead of thinking of a domain model.

Maybe I need to get back to server side development, or build command line apps. Â ðŸ¤”
