Here we are again.

I've just moved the content that I had from [Wordpress](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256361/wordpress-wp-engine-drama-explained-matt-mullenweg) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and picked a theme to get started.  Apologies 
if any of the 20-odd posts are weirdly formatted, they're mostly historical.

Its all change again.  I left Flexibits in November and am starting working for [Mindme](https://mindme.care/) this month.  I'll begin
part time, while also working on a couple of iOS projects for friends.  I'll be ramping to full time (for some 
value of full time) with Mindme over the next couple of months.

I'm pretty excited about the new opportunity.  Its a new start primarily outside the apple ecosystem, and 
its working with friends on something that affects people's daily lives.

Blogwise, I'm hoping (yet again) that I can overcome the ADHD demons to try and wrote something regularly.  

Maybe programming, whether its about the iOS work, the Elixir at Mindme, or the Amiga stuff I'd still aim to do in my spare time. 

Maybe management/coaching which will be the primary role at Mindme.

Either way.  I know more writing would be good for me, I just need to do battle with the ADHD dragon.
