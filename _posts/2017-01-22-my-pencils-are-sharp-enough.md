Its time I started blogging again.

I've had several over the years and usually end up deleting them after a while.  I used MovableType, and Ghost and Blosxom and Jekyll and all sorts of other tools.  Twitter really killed it for me.  It made it easier to throw out a thought than to sit down a craft a post. This is a wordpress site because it was quick to get working and typing.

I pulled across 3 or 4 older things I still liked, though they're ten years old and maybe not relevant any more, it meant I wasn't starting with the pressure of a blank slate.  Back then I was doing Java and Ruby.  These days its ObjectiveC and Swift.

So I guess I'll see where this goes.
