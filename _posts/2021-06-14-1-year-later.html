<p>Well, I guess its been over a year since the last post on Amiga emulation :-/</p>

<p>It was easy to spend time writing back when I was locked down at home but since going back to work its been harder.  When <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://alancfrancis.com/2020/06/08/lets-get-emulating/" target="_blank">last we spoke</a>, we had just got a basic Amiga1200 up and running with AmigaOS3.1.  Since then, AmigaOS3.2 has been released which includes a lot of work by volunteers to try and improve the now 30-year-old classic Amiga operating system.  I won't talk too much about that here as it doesn't invalidate the previous posts, except to say there's a clean, easy and legal way to get access to the OS and ROMs you need from <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/news/1-latest-news/290-amigaos-42-for-all-classic-amigas-released-and-available">Hyperion</a>.</p>

<p>I'll be back later this week to pick up where we left off, adding a second "Work" hard disk and installing a C Compiler and the Amiga NDK.</p>
